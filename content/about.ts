export const about: string = `
I am an MCA graduate from Banaras Hindu University with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven application development.
My work spans applied ML projects, independent research in computer vision, and collaborative development in production environments.
I focus on problem formulation, experimentation, and practical trade-offs rather than surface-level model application.
